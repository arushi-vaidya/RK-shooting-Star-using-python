# ODE System Solver

## Overview

The **ODE System Solver** is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to solve and visualize a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The application provides a user-friendly interface to set various parameters, solve the system, and plot the results. It is designed to be used by students, educators, and researchers working with differential equations in fields such as physics, engineering, and applied mathematics.

## Features

1. **Parameter Input**: Users can input parameters for the ODE system through sliders in the sidebar.
2. **Graphical Output**: The application displays various plots including:
   - **Collective Graph**: A comprehensive plot showing multiple functions derived from the ODE system.
   - **Individual Graphs**: Separate plots for each function, allowing for detailed analysis of each component.
3. **Data Table**: Users can load and display tabular data from a CSV file for verification purposes.

## Installation

To run the ODE System Solver locally, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- `streamlit`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy scipy matplotlib pandas
streamlit run gui.py
